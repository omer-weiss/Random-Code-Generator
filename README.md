# Random-Code-Generator

Description

My goal in working on this Random-Code-Generator was to enable users to be able to generate safe passwords using criteria of their choice. The javscript code prompts users to make choices about which criteria they want in their password. The choices are then used to figure out which set of characters will be randomly parsed through for password character values. The screen then displays the password to the user. This process involved learning and implementing javascript functions, creating global variables, if else statement and different methods, inluding math.random.
